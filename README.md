# Apple_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_Analysis_Postgresql

This repository contains SQL scripts for analyzing Apple's greenhouse gas emissions, revenue, market capitalization, and other related data using PostgreSQL. The analysis includes various window functions and common table expressions (CTEs) for data manipulation and trend analysis.

## Project Description

This project aims to analyze Apple's environmental performance, specifically focusing on greenhouse gas emissions reduction, revenue growth, and market capitalization changes over time. The analysis utilizes SQL queries with window functions and CTEs to derive insights and trends from the available data.

## Contents

- `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create the necessary tables for data analysis.
- `greenhouse_gas_analysis.sql`: SQL script for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions data.
- `revenue_market_cap_analysis.sql`: SQL script for analyzing revenue and market capitalization data.
- `window_functions_analysis.sql`: SQL script showcasing the use of window functions for trend analysis.

## Analysis Outcome

The analysis provides insights into Apple's environmental impact, revenue growth, market performance, and emission reduction efforts. Key findings include:

- Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022.
- Comparison of revenue and market capitalization between 2015 and 2022.
- Trend analysis of greenhouse gas emissions over the past 5 years.
- Comparison of emissions between different categories.
- Average annual reduction in emissions and revenue growth rate.
- Percentage of emissions from different scope sources.
- Top products contributing to carbon footprint.
- Years with maximum emissions reductions and highest revenue.
- Revenue per employee and market capitalization growth rate.
